# InteractionEconomics
General repository for working on an interactions based macroeconomic model. Using the Solow model as a baseline, we use a generalised Ising approach to incorporate interactions in the capital sphere and may extend this to the financial sphere.

### Project Structure
* `news_driven_stockmarket` contains the code for the phase diagram of Kroujiline Et Al. (2015), i.e. the original stockmarket model and thus solution to this generalised Ising approach
* `solow` will contain the code for the Solow model with dynamic capital
* `draft_work` will contain notes, and eventually the tex file structure and output related to the paper
* `literature` contains the working literature for this project, as well as a .bib file with further relevant references

### Week 1 Targets:
- [ ] Read & review the draft "A Simple Economic Model with Interactions"
    - [ ] Consider whether Solow is applicable
    - [ ] Work through each assumption in the Solow model incl. changes to original assumptions
    - [ ] Based on this work out relevant literature
- [ ] Read derivations in "Endogenous Mechanism of Business Cycles"
- [ ] Review slides for
- [ ] Generate a concise overview presentation for Michael & JP
